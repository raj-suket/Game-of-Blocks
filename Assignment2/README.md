We were to implement a smart contract in solidity for metacoin to have functions such as loan deposit and settlement of dues. We were given an initial template of metacoin.

The code should work well in Remix IDE and try it with javascript VM. You should deploy Metacoin and Loan contracts first. Then you may perform the functions provided: reqLoan, getOwnerBalance to perform such actions. 

You should keep in mind that viewDues and settleDues can only be performed by the Owner of the contract.
